# Welcome to my Research with Chris: Your Energy Transition Awareness Companion 
My first html, css and javascript webpage
Project Overview
My research website is designed to serve as a central platform for sharing, accessing, and collaborating on research materials, data, publications, and insights. It aims to facilitate knowledge sharing within the research community and engage the public in our research activities.

The website includes the following key features:

User Registration and Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

Publication Management: Researchers can add, edit, and categorize publications. Users can search and view publications.

Research Materials: Users can upload and share research materials, datasets, and resources. These materials are searchable and can be categorized.

Collaboration Tools: The website provides forums, messaging systems, and collaboration tools to facilitate communication and cooperation among researchers.

Public Outreach: The public can access research materials, view publications, and get in touch with the research team.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following tools and dependencies installed:

Git: You need Git for version control. Download and install it from https://git-scm.com/.

Web Server: To run the website locally, you can use a local web server stack (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP) or set up a development server.

PHP: The website is built using PHP, so ensure you have PHP installed. You can download it from https://www.php.net/.

MySQL Database: You will need a MySQL database to store and manage research data. Be sure to set up a database and user with appropriate permissions.

Installation
Clone the Repository: Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research-website.git
Database Setup: Create a MySQL database and import the database.sql script included in the project to set up the necessary tables.

Configuration: Open the config.php file and configure the database connection settings. You can also customize other parameters in this file.

Start the Local Server: If you're using a local server stack, start the web server and ensure PHP is running. You can access the website by navigating to http://localhost/research-website.

Usage
User Registration and Login: Use the registration form to create a new user account, or log in if you already have an account.

Publication Management: In the admin panel (accessible at http://localhost/research-website/admin), you can manage users, publications, and research materials.

Research Materials: Users can upload research materials and datasets, which are searchable and categorized.

Collaboration: Utilize the forums, messaging system, and collaboration tools to interact with other researchers and promote collaborations.

Public Outreach: The public can access your research materials, view publications, and contact your research team.
